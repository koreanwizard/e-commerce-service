* ItemValidator:
 - This object includes a 'validate' method with 'Item' parameter.
 - It checks every specific attribute from a new 'Item' object.
 - It will be executed when we try to create or update an 'Item' object (while sending 'POST' or 'PUT' requests).
 - While creating (or updating) a data, a validation process is essential.
 - If one of the condition is true from the 'execute' method, it will throw an ItemNotValidException
   with a specific 'ErrorMessages' enum.
