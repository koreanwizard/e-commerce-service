ItemController:
    HTTP Requests are created while items interacting a web browser (ex: chrome).

    The server receives and response to these requests,
    while observing the database to get or send data back to the web browser.

    HTTP Request:
    - URL (ex: www.google.com/business/)
    - query string parameters
    - header
    - request body.

    HTTP Response:
    - response body (or String),
    - HTTP Status
    ex: 200 OK -> request succeeded
    ex: 400 Bad Request -> server cannot or will not process the request due to specific errors.


'ItemController' HTTP Methods and CRUD:


    * createSingeItem (@PostMapping)
        - RequestBody is an 'Item' object and returns the 'ItemDTO' by calling 'execute' method from 'CreateItemService'


    * getEveryItem (@GetMapping)
        - returns every item that are existing inside the database: will be return as a list of ItemDTO.

    * getSingleItem (@GetMapping)
        - returns a single item that contains passed id (@PathVariable is required to pass in the item id).

    * searchItemByItemName (@GetMapping)
        - If a non-existing item has given to the query (ex: product/search?lastName=NonExistingLastName)
          or if it doesn't receive any query variables (ex: product/search?lastName=) it still works.
          However, if the query variable is not mentioned (ex: product/search)
          this will give an error ("Required parameter 'lastName' is not present.")
          'Postman' (an API platform) has been used to test these events.

    * searchItemByItemColor (@GetMapping)
        - Same logic as 'searchItemByItemName' Http method.

    * updateSingleItem (@PutMapping)
        - updates the item that includes a certain id. the item that want to be updated will be the body of request
        - the 'UpdateItemCommand' class has been created to store item's id and the actual item.
        - the 'execute' method from 'UpdateItemService' uses a 'save' Jpa method to update attributes.

    



ItemRepository:
    An interface that inherits the JpaRepository with 'Item' as a generic T and 'Integer' as ID.
    This provides free JpaRepository methods that helps to read or modify data from the database.
    ex) findAll(), deleteAll()

    If there is a query that is too complex for JPA, we can create a custom query by using @Query annotation.
    ex: @Query(SELECT item FROM Item item WHERE item.itemName LIKE %:keyword%)

    * findByItemNameContainingIgnoreCase
        - It finds every item that contains a specific keyword.
        - The 'ContainingIgnoreCase' keyword refers following JPQL snippet:
        SELECT item FROM items WHERE LOWER(item_name) LIKE LOWER(CONCAT('%', ?, '%'));
        This is almost same as the raw customized query from above, but it includes the CONCAT.
        It is a JPQL function that joins two or more strings into one string.
        WHERE LOWER(item_name) -> converts the 'item_name' column to lowercase
        LIKE -> an SQL operator that matches a pattern (it use with '%' when partial match is required)
        LOWER(CONCAT('%', ?, '%')) -> - a wildcard search with containing parameter placeholder '?'
                                      this will be replaced by the actual word that user inserted to find items
                                      - the CONCAT will add up every element and lowercase the word that user typed in
        Intuitive Example (just for a learning purpose): LIKE %lower_cased_string_that_user_typed_in%

    * findByItemColorContainingIgnoreCase
        - Same logic as 'findByItemNameContainingIgnoreCase'


@PathVariable: used when the value (ex: 'id') is a part of the URL structure
@RequestParam: used when passing optional filters (ex: 'itemName')
We can specify the exact path/query variable after these annotations.
@RequestParam("itemName"): annotation 뒤에 들어 가는 optional query variable 를 표시해 주니까
postman 에서 테스트 해볼 때 에러가 안 났었음.
