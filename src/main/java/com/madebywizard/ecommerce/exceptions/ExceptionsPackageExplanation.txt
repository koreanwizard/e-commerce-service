ItemNotFoundException:
This exception occurs when an item is not found. The error message is an 'ErrorMessages' enum object.
It uses a 'getMessage' method to get the message (String).



GlobalExceptionHandler:
This exists to manage various exception handlers in one global location.
It includes a @ControllerAdvice to easily handle exceptions.
The @ControllerAdvice will handle exceptions that are located in 'GlobalExceptionHandler' with
@ExceptionHandler annotation.

  - handleCustomerNotFoundException: An exception that will occur when customer is not found. It takes an 'CustomerNotFoundException'
  as a parameter, and it will return a ResponseEntity<ErrorResponse> with HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND (404) and passing a 'ErrorResponse'
  as a body of the response.

  - handleCustomerNotValidException: An exception that will occur when customer information is not valid. The rest of logic is
  same as 'handleCustomerNotFoundException' method, but it includes the HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST (400).
